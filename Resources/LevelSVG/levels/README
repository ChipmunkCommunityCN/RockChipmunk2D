Steps used to create the levels:
-------------------------------


Level0:
=======

1. Create a tile map using Tiled ( http://mapeditor.org ). Tiled is supported by cocos2d
2. Save the project as "level0.tmx". 
3. Save the project as an image: "level0.png". This image is not used in the game
    -> Tiled -> File -> Save As Image
4. Open Inkscape and create a new document of 480x320. Actually it can be of any size, but 480x320 is useful as a reference.
    -> Inkscape -> File -> Document Properties -> Custom size: width=480, height=320
5. Create 2 layers:
    -> physics:objects
    -> tmx map
6. Select the "tmx map" layer, and import the "level0.png" image.
    -> Inkscape -> File -> Import -> Select "level0.png"
7. Place the image at (0,0)
    -> Select the image and modify x=0, y=0
8. Select the "physics:object" layer and start placing your physics object!

Since the tiles will be rendered using a CCTMXTiledMap object, you should use "invisible tiles" objects in the physics:object layer.

Files used in the game:
    - level0.tmx    (to render the tiles)
    - level0.svg

For further info, please see Level0.mm

Level1:
=======

1. Open Inkscape and create a new document of 480x320. Actually it can be of any size, but it is useful as a reference.
    -> Inkscape -> File -> Document Properties -> Custom size: width=480, height=320
2. Create 1 layer:
    -> physics:objects
3. Design the world
4. Once you finish it, duplicate that layer
    -> Inkscape -> Layer -> Duplicate current Layer
5. Rename the new layer to: "graphics"
6. Select the "graphics" layer and "paint it".
7. Disable the "physics:objects" layer
    -> Inkscape -> Layer -> Layers -> click on the "eye" of "physics:objects" layer
8. Export the image as bitmap
    -> Inkscape -> File -> Page
9. The new exported image (level1.png) will be used as the background image

Files used in the game:
    - level1.png    (the background image)
    - level1.svg

For further info, please see Level1.mm


Level2:
=======

1. Open Inkscape and create a new document of 480x320. Actually it can be of any size, but it is useful as a reference.
    -> Inkscape -> File -> Document Properties -> Custom size: width=480, height=320
2. Create 1 layer:
    -> physics:objects
3. Start designing the world.

Level2 is a self-render map. The platforms know how to render so there is no need to use a background image or a TMX tile map.

Files used in the game:
    - level2.svg

For further info, please see Level2.mm


Level3:
=======

1. Open Inkscape and create a new document of 480x320. Actually it can be of any size, but it is useful as a reference.
    -> Inkscape -> File -> Document Properties -> Custom size: width=480, height=320
2. Create 1 layer:
    -> physics:objects
3. Start designing the world.
4. The bezier "platforms" are rendered using the Box2dDebug method. Only use this alternative for debuggin purposes.

Files used in the game:
    - level3.svg

Level4:
=======

Uses the same technique as Level0

Files used in the game:
    - level4.tmx        (the tiles)
    - level4.svg
